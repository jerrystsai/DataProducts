## Simple Algebra Practice project documentation

### Summary
This project lets the user do algebra problems with 2 equations and 2 unknowns: *x* and *y*. The idea is to give the user the opportunity to practice solving these relatively simple problems so that she or he will gain confidence.

### Explanation
The possible values for each of the unknowns are integers ranging from -5 to 5, excluding 0. 
The possible coefficients for the unknowns also are integers that range from -5 to 5, excluding 0.
These values were chosen so that the calculations would not get too laborious. 

The user is given two opportunities to solve the problem. If the user cannot solve the problem, the correct answers are given.

Two numeric input boxes and a "Submit" button provide the interface by which the user's proposed answers are evaluated.
